For classes, you can use -

final - The class cannot be inherited by other classes

abstract - The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class.

For attributes and methods -

final -	Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified,
        Java final is equivalent to C++ const on primitive value. 

static - Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object

abstract - Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. 
           The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run().
           The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
