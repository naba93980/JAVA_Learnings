Lambda expressions -> anonymous function that has no access specifier, name, may not have return type, parameter type

Functional Interfaces -> it is an Interface that has only one abstract method(called functional method) - eg. Runnable, Comparator method
It can have default methods as well but abstract method only one
It is shown by @FunctionalInterface annotation (not mandatory tho)

Predicate -> function with single argument and returns boolean value
implemented using Predicate interface(functional Interfaces) with one abstractt method that takes one argumnet
since it is functional Interfaces, we can implemente it using lambda expression
