hashtable and vector as legacy classes as methods in these classes are synchronized and doesnot help in multithreading

Java collections only store Objects, not primitive types; however we can store the wrapper classes

array list are ordered and contagious
linked list are ordered and random

sets doesnot allow duplicated
hashset are not ordered
linkedhashset are ordered
treeset sorts the element objects that we add to it

queue-
linkedlist(fifo), priorityqueue(custom order), blockingqueue extends from queue

priorityqueue:
duplicates not allowed
insertion order is not preserved
default natural sorting ordering
null values not allowed
customized sorting
