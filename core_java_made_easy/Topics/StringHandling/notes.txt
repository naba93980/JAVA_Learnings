jvm treats objects of user-defined class & wrapper types differently
prints object of user-defined class as reference
prints object of wrapper class after calling the toString() method, also the values of String object is immutable

String class is immutable - properties or state cannot be changed

equals() method in object class (which by default compares just memory references)  is overridden in String class()
