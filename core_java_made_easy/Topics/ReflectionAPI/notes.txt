Reflection API allows your program to "reflect" on itself or other classes, like looking into a mirror to see your own reflection,
It allows you to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and other elements of your code, but it does not directly modify the code itself.


Inspecting Classes: 
You can obtain information about classes such as their name, superclass, interfaces they implement, and constructors they have.

Accessing Fields: 
You can retrieve information about fields within a class, including their names, types, and values.

Invoking Methods: 
You can call methods on classes by their names and parameter types, even if you didn't know about those methods at compile time.

Creating Instances: 
You can create new instances of classes dynamically, which can be useful when you don't know the exact class to instantiate until runtime.

Accessing Annotations: 
You can retrieve and process annotations attached to classes, methods, fields, etc., during runtime, allowing you to respond to metadata within your code.
