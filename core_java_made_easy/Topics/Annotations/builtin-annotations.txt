Some of the most commonly used built-in annotations provided by the JDK (Java Development Kit):

@Override: Indicates that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method in its superclass.
@Deprecated: Marks a class, method, field, or other element as outdated and discouraged from use.
@SuppressWarnings: Instructs the compiler to suppress specific warnings for the annotated element or code block.
@SafeVarargs: Indicates that a method with a varargs parameter is safe to call, even if it generates unchecked warnings.
@FunctionalInterface: Marks an interface as a functional interface, ensuring it has exactly one abstract method.
@Nullable and @NonNull: Indicate whether a variable or parameter can be null or non-null, respectively.
@Documented: Specifies that the annotated element should be included in the generated JavaDoc documentation.
@Retention: Specifies how long an annotation should be retained. Possible values include SOURCE, CLASS, and RUNTIME.
@Target: Specifies where an annotation can be applied. Possible values include TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, etc.
@Inherited: Indicates that an annotation declared on a superclass should be inherited by its subclasses.
@Repeatable: Allows an annotation to be applied multiple times to the same element.
@Native: Marks a method as a bridge to a native implementation.
