static code is executed at the time of class loading
non-static code is executed at time of object creation, before constructor is invoked
java doesnot support multiple inheritance
abstract class cant have object
class that re marked final cant be inherited(abstract class cant be final)
abstract methods cant be static (coz static method means common for all object, but abstract methods means different class(objecs) will have its own implementations)
by default all methods in interface are public abstract
final class cant be extended or inherited
final variable can't be assigned different value
final method cant be overridden
variables in interface are public, static and final  
foreach loop cannot be used for assigning value
