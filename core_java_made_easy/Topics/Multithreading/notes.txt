1. new state
2. active state
    runnable state  
    running state
3. waiting or blocked state
4. terminated state

thread.join() or Thread.sleep() -> waiting state 
object to be used being used by some other thread -> blocked state

Here's a simplified explanation of how Thread.currentThread() works:

Each thread created by the JVM has its own thread-local variable.
The thread-local variable stores a reference to the Thread object representing that thread.
When Thread.currentThread() is invoked, the JVM retrieves the current thread-local variable associated with the executing thread.
The Thread object stored in the thread-local variable is returned.


yield() -> Preemptive Scheduling
sleep() / join() / wait() -> Non-Preemptive Scheduling
