Here are some key points about daemon threads:

Daemon threads are created using the setDaemon(true) method on a Thread instance before starting the thread. if u try to set a thread as daemon after it started it will throw IllegalThreadStateException

By default, threads created in Java are non-daemon threads.

Daemon threads are typically used for background tasks or services that support the main operation of the program.

When the JVM determines that only daemon threads are running, it can terminate the program and exit without waiting for the daemon threads to complete.

Daemon threads are commonly used for tasks like garbage collection, monitoring, logging, or periodic maintenance activities.

Daemon threads should not perform critical operations or tasks that require guaranteed completion, as they can be abruptly terminated when the JVM exits.
